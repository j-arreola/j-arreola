-  Hi, I’m @j-arreola
-  I’m currently learning SQL, DAX (Data Analysis Expressions), RStudio, Python and am enrolled in the Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Professional Certificate and Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program through Coursera. I intend on working as a full-time data analyst.
-  I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can be used as a part of my portfolio, centered on supply chain management, business cases, domestic and international economic trends, and the analysis of supply chain disruptions that occurred due to the Covid pandemic.
